		  The Addis Ababa Branch Office is the most active branch. This is because, before regional branches were opened, it has been working for all the deaf in the country. It has many highly experienced members. However, it is not the oldest branch. That was because, the activities that are now being carried out by the Addis Ababa Branch Office were being under taken by the ENAD head office. However, that arrangement was causing some friction. So, the deaf in Addis Ababa demanded to have a branch office and that was how the branch came into being.
