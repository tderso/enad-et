<h2>Number of deaf persons</h2>
<div class="collection" id="stat-table-top">
  <p>
    The data shown below is to be taken with utmost care. The column headed "Active members" give data estimates by the ENAD office. But, the reasoning under which these estimates were made is not clear. The only rationalizaion that was given was it was needed to justify for project funding.
  </p>
  <p>
    The column headed "Deaf Population" is obtained from published reports by the Cental Statistics Agency for the 2007 Population and Housing Census. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Two totals are given for each region. The first is the actual total from the population census (shown in rows in light green color). The second is the total of deaf who are found in places where the ENAD has branch offices (sown in the row with light green color).
  </p>
  <p>
    Although there is a ten year gap between the ENAD estimates and the 2007 population census, still, the ENAD estimates are way off. For Example, the number of deaf in Asaita from the population census of 2007 was given as 11 persons. But, the ENAD estimate for Asaita in 2017 is given s 298 persons. This is not possible. The same problem is observed for Bahirdar, Debre Berhan, Fnote Selam, Gonder, Gambela, Ambo, Bale Robe, Jigjiga, Aleta Wondo. In some cases, the error seems to be with the population census data. Because, actual visits by ENAD staff have established the existence of more deaf than reported by the census.
  </p>

    Currently, the following are the branch offices of the ENAD.
