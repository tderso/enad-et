The project is being implemented with a grant amounting to ETB 670,000.00 obtained from the 
Australian Embassy's Embassy **Small Grants Program**. The project is a 
six months deaf women empowerment project designed to address the
ever increasing rate of gender based violence against
deaf girls, rape, unwanted pregnancy, sexual transmitted
disease and violation of the sexual and reproductive
health rights of deaf girls in Ethiopia. Its specific objective
is to empower 750 deaf girls, through peer education,
to be able to make their own decisions about their
health, body and sexual life and equip them with the
advocacy tools needed to stand up for their rights and
protect themselves. It also aims to reach a minimum of
30,000 non-disabled citizens through advocacy activities
throughout the country and increase the awareness level
of deaf girls’ sexual and reproductive health rights by at
least 25% in six months.
