The International Week of the Deaf 1999 was very colorfully observed at the ENAD Hall with the assistant of the late Mr. Belai Teklu. Mr. Teklu was well known businessman, particularly at the very busy Markatto Area near to the Abune Teklehaimanot Church of Addis Ababa because of his pastry business that catered to a lot of clients.

What made Mr. Belai Teklu's assistance so special was that not only did he make financial contribution but also he announced that ENAD members will receive wedding cakes free of charge at their weddings. Because of his generous decision, some of our members were able to take advantage of it. All they needed to do was take a letter from the ENAD confirming the individual to be one of our members and that he/she was holding a wedding.

Mr. Teklu had also the aim of making improvements on the ENAD Hall with a raised stage structure so that members could very easily follow deliberations during meetings and artistic performance with unobstructed view. Sadly, he passed away before his vision could be realized.

What is more, even after the death of Mr. Teklu, his family continued to provide wedding cakes to our members. They have also been providing us for free, cookies and other products during the observance of the International Week of the Deaf. <!--The latest such assistance was in 2016. --> We are hopeful that this exemplary generosity will continue even in the future.
