The first ever educational seminar on HIV/AIDs was offered to 100 members of the ENAD by Liya Yihdego from 27 July to 1 August 1998 through the support of Gallaudet University. At that time, she was a student at the Gallaudet University. She gave the training assisted by Rene Visco<!-- who was then Liya's boy friend -->. That training was an eye opener to the ENAD Executive Committee, which at the time was known as ENAD Board.

The ENAD Board then approached the Ministry of Health and asked for further training to be provided to the deaf. The Ministry of Health kindly agreed and the training seminar was organized from 8 February to 14 March 1999. Expert trainers were provided by the Ministry for the purpose.
