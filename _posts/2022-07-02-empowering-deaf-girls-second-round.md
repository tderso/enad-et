The Ethiopian National Association of the Deaf (ENAD) conducted a two days’ workshop for 46 women peer educators and men/youth representatives from 24 ENAD branches across the country. The training was a part of **Mybody my Rights and my Deafness** Project supported by Australian Embassy, in Ethiopia, Small Scale Projects. The aim of the training was to enable women and men/youth representatives to work together in eliminating violence against women in all its forms. In addition they were equipped with advocacy skills to enable them jointly work in advocating for their common rights at their respective branches and beyond.

The leadership of ENAD has reaffirmed its commitments  to continue working with the committees to maintain the gains so far and and ensure that women and youths are adequately represented in the general assembly as well us in executive committee/board of ENAD.
