	<h2>An Enduring Partnership</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			During the time of Emperor Haile Selassie, Finland was one of the Nordic countries that was supporting the school for the deaf at Keren, in present day Eritrea, which was then part of Ethiopia. The support was through religious missionaries.
		</p>
		<p>
			The current partnership begun in 1991 in the form of a training seminar. It was the Second Eastern and Southern Africa Sign Language Seminar which was organized by the ENAD with the financial support of the FAD. The Seminar brought participants from five Eastern and Southern African countries as well as experts from the FAD.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the time, Ethiopia was under the leadership of the Derg regime. Like other countries from the west, Finland seems to have had a policy of not supporting Ethiopia at the time. The support to organize the Seminar seems to have been done on an exceptional basis since the majority of the beneficiary of the training were from countries on which Finland did not have any prohibitions. Although ENAD was being invited to participate at meetings and seminars organized by FAD in other Eastern and Southern African countries, it had to wait until a regime change took place before it could hope to get direct support from Finland. Luckily for the deaf, the change came so soon after the Seminar had taken place, and after about a month to be exact.

			Selected ENAD members were beneficiaries of a FAD project that was based in Zambia, the Eastern and Southern African Regional Sign Language Project (ESARSLP). Through that project, 16 members were trained as sign language instructors by providing them four rounds of training sessions at Debre Zeit <!-- , each round lasting for _____ days -->. The same project also made it possible to provide two rounds of training to 16 sign language interpreters. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The first direct support to the ENAD from FAD came in the form of the Ethiopian Sign Language Dictionary Project. Almost 15 years had passed since the preparation of the first book on Ethiopian Sign Language. That book had gone out of print some years earlier. Ever since the publication of that first book, the deaf community had come up with many more new signs. There was a very pressing need to collect, collate and publish these signs along with the former ones. Thus, the Ethiopian Sign Language Dictionary Project was formulated and supported by the FAD. It was a very big undertaking that was started in 2008. The publication of the dictionary was endorsed by his Excellency President Girma Wolde Giorgis former president of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the inauguration ceremony, the ENAD had invited many different governmental and non-governmental organizations including all the four religious organizations. The ENAD is very happy to note that the inauguration ceremony was presided over by His Holiness Abune Pawlos, the late patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church.
		</p>
		<p>
			 The project also supported the distribution of the dictionary to schools and to all the ENAD branches.

  <h2>Deaf Women Empowerment and HIV/AIDs Prevention Project 2008 - 2011</h2>
  <div>
		<p>
      The second project that was supported by the FAD and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland was Capacity Building of Deaf Women, Prevention of HIV/AIDs and Reproductive Health. It was implemented in seven branches located in Addis Ababa, Amhara (Bahirdar), Diredawa, Oromiya (Adama), Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples State (Hawassa) and Tigrai (Adigrat and Mekelle) from 2008 to 2011. It had also a component for holding regular peer to peer discussion and counseling through the medium of coffee/tea ceremony.

		<p>
			The third project that was implemented in 2013 to 2016 was a continuation of the second. It was implemented in eight branches located at Addis Ababa, Amhara (Debreberhan and Dessie), Oromia (Ambo and Jimma), Harari and Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples State (Arbaminch and Hossaena). This time, it also included a vocational training component and 10 deaf members from each of the 8 branches (a total of 80 members) benefited from the training. They organized themselves into cooperatives and the project provided them with start-up materials.
