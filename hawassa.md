			Hawassa is the regional capital of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' State (SNNPS). It is a very picturesque city located at the shore Lake Hawassa. Lake Hawassa is a hangout for many different birds. One of ENAD's branches is located in Hawassa.
		</p>
		<p>
			The ENAD branch in this beautiful city is a very active branch. By securing support from the region's Agency of Labor and Social Affairs, it has been providing service not only to the deaf in the city but also to deaf in the region. It has organized training sessions for participants from the other branches in the region
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2013, the branch observed the International Week of Deaf by holding ameeting at <a href="http://www.hailehotelsandresorts.com/">Haile Resort</a>. At that meeting 53 deaf and other persons had participated. <a href="http://www.hailehotelsandresorts.com/">Haile Resort</a> not only provided the hall free of charge but also provided tea and coffee service to the participants.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2014, the branch observed the International Week of the Deaf at Alta Wondo in collaboration with ENAD's Aleta Wondo branch. The participants included 35 members from Hawassa and 45 others from Aleta Wondo. The regional administration provided a bus with a driver and fuel that enabled the deaf from Hawassa to undertake the round trip from Hawassa to Aleta Wondo and back while the NGO Light for Children suborted the branches with a donation of Birr 5,000 that made it possible for the vent to be held successfully.

			The branch has also observed the International Week of the Deaf 2017 at Hawassa for three days. The opening ceremony was held at <a href="http://www.hailehotelsandresorts.com/">Haile Resort</a> and was attended by the deaf, other persons with disabilities and some members of the public. The event was opened by the president of the Ethiopian National Association of the Deaf. The deaf walked from the office of the branch to <a href="http://www.hailehotelsandresorts.com/">Haile Resort</a>, a distance of three km. During their walk, the police from the Hawassa bureau provided the necessary support and insured the easy flow of traffic. The event was also well covered by the regional TV station.
