		<p>
      One thing the ENAD has been most active consistently over the years has been in the participation of its members in sports. In order to support sportive activities of its members, members had agreed to contribute money on top of the monthly membership contributions they have been making. Although the amount was minimal, it however shows the interest every member has to support sportive activities.

      </div>

		<p>
			Long before the government's Sport Commission had included sports of PWDs among its activities, PWDs used to organize annual sports competitions by themselves. PWDs from the Hagere Tibeb Factory, the United Abilities Umbrella and Dry Cells Factories and the ENAD used to participate at these events.  ENAD members had even gone as far as Adama, Diredawa and Jimma to participate in sport competitions.

		<p>
      One sport in which the deaf have been actively participating and holding competitions is football (soccer). Deaf are so active in football that to some, sport means football. Not only in competition, it is a favorite pass time.
    </p>
    <p>
    	As the ENAD does not have a playing field of its own, its footballers used to frequent an open field that was located near the Ghion Hotel. But, that field was taken over by the Hotel and developed as part of its park. Then the deaf footballers moved to an open field located at Abuare.
    </p>
    <div class="thumbnail pull-left tiny">

      </div>
    </div> 
    <p>
    	But, that was also taken over for housing development. For some time after that, the deaf footballers used an open field located near the Armed Forces Hospital. Then, following a request from the ENAD, the Addis Ababa University was kind enough to allow the deaf to use its football and Volley ball fields at Sidist Kilo during weekends for some years. This was a very convenient arrangement as the ENAD office is located near by. Currently, the deaf are using the grounds at Jan Meda. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	The lack of a permanent location with adequate facilities is a big challenge to our sportsmen and women. It has been under very difficult conditions that they have been participating due to their love for the sport.
    </p>
	</div>
	<h2>Athletics</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
      Athletics competitions are also favorites of many. Ethiopia being a country of many world famous runners, the deaf also are fond of athletics.
    </p>
	</div>
	<h2>Deaf women's participation</h2>

		<p>
			Deaf women members were also active participants in sports. They used to engage themselves in weekly volleyball games, running and jogging in addition to participating in indoor games. They were active participants in the annual competitions as well. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	The ENAD had some notable fast women runners who won many medals at annual sports competitions.
    </p>
	</div>
	<h2>Indoor Games</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			Indoor games were also frequented a lot. At the ENAD Assembly Hall, deaf used to play table tennis, darts, draughts, chess. On Wednesdays and Fridays and during weekends, the ENAD hall used to be crowded with members who used to come to watch or compete.
