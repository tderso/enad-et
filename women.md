	<h2>ENAD's Women's Section</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			A Women's Section has existed at the ENAD since a long time ago. It started in the 1970's in the form of "Helen Sports Team", that brought deaf women members together. That evolved to a Women's Section some years later.

		<p>
			Deaf women have participated in the management of the ENAD from its earliest days. Among the first executive committee of the ENAD, who are legally considered the founders was one woman member. She was Ms. Simegn Woldeberhan. After her, many other deaf women have actively participated and are also still participating in all the management and leadership roles of the ENAD.

		<p>
			The advent of the deadly HIV/AIDS pandemic brought additional role to the Women's Section. ENAD deaf women members have been at the fore front in the fight against HIV/AIDs as trainees, trainers and leaders. Every time the ENAD has some event going, it is unthinkable such an event would be successful without the involvement of women members.

			ENAD women members from Addis Ababa have braved rain, sun, wind, long tiresome drives and other hazards to go as far as Gambela, Assosa, Jigjiga, Adigrat, Gonder, Asaita and other places to bring enlightenment to their deaf sisters and bothers in the regions. Their efforts have not been in vain. Now, many deaf women in the regions have become active participants in the work of the ENAD. In all these activities, they have been supported mainly by project funds from the Finnish Association of the Deaf, by the regional bureaus of Labor and Social Affairs and other NGOs.
